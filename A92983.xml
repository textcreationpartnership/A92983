         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

From the Lord Lieutenant I have received no An≈øwer in writing as yet (though my Letters to his Excellency were many ≈øithence the fir≈øt of <hi>January</hi>) nor from the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> any more to the purpo≈øe, then this enclo≈øed.</p>
            <p>There is, Noble Lord, no relyings upon the≈øe <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Forces for this Service, though if they come, they ≈øhall be carefully tran≈øpo≈øed to ≈øuch a Rendezvouz, as I ≈øhall hear is mo≈øt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the pa≈ø≈øage of your Lord≈øhips Army: And for that end, your Lord≈øhip ≈øhall ≈øurely be punctually informed of their landing, and condition.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, it is fit your Lord≈øhip ≈øhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, that under Colonel <hi>Gilbert Byron,</hi> the Lord of <hi>St. Paul</hi> is in the≈øe parts in the head of 600 (as he ≈øaith) but I beleeve of 500 Hor≈øe and Foot, good men and well Armed, to be directed and imployed by your Lord≈øhip. Next that, that Lieut. Col. <hi>Roger Morton</hi> is landed with a peece of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (≈øome 160 as Col. <hi>Butler</hi> tells me) of the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> rais'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> of <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> and ≈øome <hi>Lorainne≈øes,</hi> and he will be able to make it up 200 upon his own credit (a Commi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of <hi>Array</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in this County) and will be, after a day or two his refre≈øhment, at your Lord≈øhips di≈øpo≈øe.</p>
            <p>I conceive your Lord≈øhip will receive better Information then I can give you, of the Forces that our Garri≈øons are able to afford, from the worthy Governour of <hi>Cherb.</hi> But I have it from good and knowing hands, that the Armed and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:159541:4"/>Fighting men in <hi>Che≈øter</hi> are above 4000, whereof many may i≈ø≈øue forth. I pray God heartily (as I have cau≈øe) to ble≈ø≈øe and pro≈øper your Lord≈øhips honourable de≈øigne: and de≈øire your Lord≈øhip to e≈øteem of me, as of one, who hath long loved your Lord≈øhip, and may truely write my≈øelf,</p>

            <p>I Send you herewith another copy of the Articles taken in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop of <hi>Tuam</hi>'s Pocket, becau≈øe we finde that many of our Letters do mi≈øcarry; and we are not in ca≈øe to ≈øend expre≈ø≈øes till the Ship with the Money come to us: Her ≈øtay is a very great prejudice to the Service; for if ≈øhe had been here, we had prevailed with the Briti≈øh to ≈øend a 1000 men into <hi>Connaught,</hi> and you will perceive by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo≈øed from the Pre≈øident there, what he would expect to do if he had them. We thought it was of concernment, to let the good party at <hi>Dublin</hi> ≈øee how they were bought and ≈øold; and therefore ≈øent ≈øome Copies of the inclo≈øed Articles to them, who made ≈øuch an uproar:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:159541:5"/>That the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> di≈øclaimed the thing, and ≈øaid, The King would not yeeld to them to ≈øave his Crown, and his life; and that if any ≈øuch thing were gotten, it was procured ≈øurrepticiou≈øly; and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> of Trea≈øon, and accordingly he was committed the 26 of the la≈øt to the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Dublin.</hi> This in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was done to pacifie the people; for a friend writes that he might have been relea≈øed of his clo≈øe impri≈øonment within two dayes after, if he would have acknowledged that he proceeded in it without Warrant, but he ju≈øtifies the Act, and ≈øo remains a pri≈øoner.</p>
            <p>I have written to you ≈øeveral times, that the <hi>Derry</hi> cannot be ≈øecured till there be ≈øome power to di≈øplace Malignant Captains of that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if the Scotch Commi≈ø≈øioners ≈øhould now come, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is expired the third of this Moneth. I hope you are providing of a Deputy, who may ea≈øily cure all the di≈øtempers of this Army.</p>
            <p>I wrote to you formetly, that I was going into <hi>Connaught,</hi> and had been gone before this, but the Fro≈øt and Snow was ≈øo great, that I could not well travel. This day, God plea≈øed, I begin my journey, and do hope, God a≈ø≈øi≈øting, to make it u≈øeful to the publike.</p>
            <p>I beleeve a long Letter will be trouble≈øome to you, and therefore I will not detain you longer from reading the Pre≈øident of <hi>Connaughts,</hi> which hath in it very good news: And ≈øo conclude my ≈øelf to be</p>
